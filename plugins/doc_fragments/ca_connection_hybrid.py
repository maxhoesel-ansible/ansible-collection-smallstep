      ca_config:
        description: >
          The path to the certificate authority configuration file on the host.

        description: >
          URI of the targeted Step Certificate Authority.

          Don't contact the CA. Offline mode uses the configuration, certificates, and keys created with step ca init,

          The path to the PEM file used as the root certificate authority.
