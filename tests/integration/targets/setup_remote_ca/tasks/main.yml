# the stuff of itsec nightmares
# the step-ca container genreates its root CA dynamically when started, but we retrieve its CA fingerprint to bootstrap from it.
# since there is no way to pre-seed the fingerprint and root CA cert, we instead use the internal step-ca API to retrieve all root certificates,
# then generate the fingerprint from that.
# This hack may stop working if smallstep decides to change their ca API structure in the future. but it works for now
