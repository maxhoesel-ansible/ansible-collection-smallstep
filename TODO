pytest-ansible, get familiar with test syntax
1. fixture to set up a dev container with step installed (can be dockerfiled)
2. fixture to set up a ca (per-test maybe?)
3. test uses ansible inventory with container
4. cleanup?

CI, get nox scenarios (or pytest? circleci integration? coverage?)

ansible-test local-ca, ensure python version matches
actually check node python in general
