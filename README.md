**NOTE**

This collection (and the upstream `step-cli`/`step-ca` packages) are still under active development and do not have an official stable release yet.
Breaking changes may occur between minor releases (e.g. 0.2 -> 0.3) if they are needed to keep up with upstream changes.

An Ansible collection for managing Smallstep CLI and CA applications.

This collection contains role and modules to help you install, configure, and maintain both the step-cli client and the CA server using Ansible.

## Installation

### Dependencies

- ansible-base, either the most recent release or the release before
- Python 3.6 or newer

Individual roles and modules may have additional dependencies, please check their respective documentation.

### Install via ansible-galaxy

Install this role via ansible-galaxy:

`ansible-galaxy collection install maxhoesel.smallstep`

You can also install the most recent version of this collection by referencing this repository:

`ansible-galaxy collection install git+https://github.com/maxhoesel/ansible-collection-smallstep`

## Usage

In addition to a set of modules that wrap around `step-cli` commands to perform typical `step-cli`/`ca` operations,
this collection also contains several roles that run more broad tasks related to `step-cli` and `step-ca`. They are:

- `step_ca`: Install and initialize a step certificate authority on a host
- `step_bootstrap_host`: Initialize a host to trust an existing step CA and create a service user for communicating with the CA via `step-cli`
- `step_acme_cert`: Generate and install and ACME certificate for a host from an existing step CA. Also sets up automatic renewal.
- `step_cli`: Install the `step-cli` client on a host. This role is used by `step_ca` and `step_bootstrap_host` and
              it is recommended that you use these roles unless you really only want `step-cli` for some reason


### Basic setup

In this scenario you want to create an internal CA for a group of hosts to trust and get TLS certs from.
Your inventory will probably look a little like the one below:

```
all:
  children:
    step_ca:
      my-ca.localdomain
    clients:
      hosta.localdomain
      hostb.localdomain
      hostc.localdomain
```

First, you will need to create a step CA on the CA host.
Below is a simple example for how to do so (check the `step_ca` docs for more details):

`ca.yml`:

```yaml
- hosts: step_ca
  become: yes
  tasks:
    # Install and initialize the CA server.
    # There are a lot of configuration options, see the step_ca README for details
    - name: Install step-ca
      include_role:
        name: maxhoesel.smallstep.step_ca
      vars:
        step_ca_name: Foobar Internal CA
        step_ca_root_password: "incredibly secret password"
        step_ca_intermediate_password: "very secret password"

    # The CA root cert fingerprint is used by clients to verify the authenticity of your CA.
    # You can save the output of this task and then pass it on to any client that you want to trust the CA.
    - name: Get root CA fingerprint
      command: `step-cli certificate fingerprint /etc/step-ca/certs/root_ca.crt`
      register: root_ca_fp
    - name: Show root CA fingerprint
      debug:
        msg: "Fingerprint of root cert: {{ root_ca_fp.stdout }}"
```

Now that your CA is up and running, it's time to configure the clients to trust the CA:

`clients.yml`:

```yaml
- hosts: clients
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Bootstrap the hosts to trust the CA
      include_role:
        name: maxhoesel.smallstep.step_bootstrap_host
      vars:
        # These values point the hosts to your newly created CA
        step_bootstrap_ca_url: https://my-ca.localdomain
        step_bootstrap_fingerprint: "your root CA certs fingerprint"

    # `step` is the default service user created by step_bootstrap_host. This user
    # is configured to access the CA and can be used to get certs, check the CA status and so on.
    - name: Verify that everything is working
      command: step-cli ca health
      changed_when: no
      become_user: step
```

At this point, your CA is up and running and your hosts are configured to trust it. You're ready to go!
You can take a look at the available modules to further configure your CA and hosts if you whish to do so.

### About step-cli config and service users

Most of the modules in this collection wrap around the `step-cli` command, which reads its configuration from
`$STEPPATH` (`~/.step` by default). Alternatively, it is possible to pass required configuration parameters via command-line args.

This collection makes things easy for you by installing a cli and ca user with the `step_bootstrap_host` and `step_ca` roles respectively
These users are named `step` and `step-ca` and can access the CA remotely/locally without any further configuration required.

You can also pass the required parameters via module args (e.g. `ca_url` for remote access or `ca_config` if the CA is local), but
this is not recommended.

---
**NOTE**

Some modules can be run both remotely via the client and directly on the CA (e.g. `step_ca_certificate`), while others are remote/local-only
(e.g. `step_ca_bootstrap` is remote-only, while `step_ca_provisioner` is local-only). See the module documentation for details.

---

```yaml
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Run a step-cli command
      command: step-cli ca health
      become_user: step
    - name: Run a module instead
      maxhoesel.smallstep.step_ca_certificate:
        # module args
      become_user: step

    - name: run a module against a local CA
      maxhoesel.smallstep.step_ca_provisioner:
        # module args
      become_user: step-ca
```

### Getting ACME certs from the CA

One possible use case for a internal CA is to issue short-lived host certificates via the ACME protocol.
This collection has a role specifically for that - `step_acme_cert`. Below is a simple example for setting
up an ACME workflow.

---
**NOTE**

Make sure that you are familiar with the way ACME works. You will need a functioning DNS environment at the very least
to make use of ACME certs.

---

`acme.yml`:

```yaml
- hosts: step_ca
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Add an ACME provisioner to the CA
      maxhoesel.smallstep.step_ca_provisioner:
        name: ACME
        type: ACME
      become_user: step-ca
      notify: reload step-ca
  handlers:
    - name: reload step-ca
      systemd:
        name: step-ca
        state: reloaded

- hosts: clients
  become: yes
  tasks:
    # This will download a certificate to /etc/step/ that you can then use in other applications.
    # See the step_acme_cert README for more options
    - name: Configure an ACME cert + renewal
      include_tasks:
        name: maxhoesel.smallstep.step_acme_cert
        vars:
          step_acme_cert_ca_provisioner: ACME
      become_user: step

```
