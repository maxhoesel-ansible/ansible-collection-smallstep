# Requirements for developing this collection
# Includes utilities, CLI helpers and so on

# Include a version of ansible-core for IDE hints and the default pytest version
# It is also needed for docs generation.

# This installed version can be overriden by running pytest with the --ansible-version command.

# is ancient and incompatible with python 3.12.
