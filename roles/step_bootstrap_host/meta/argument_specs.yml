    short_description: Install C(step-cli) on a host and configure it to trust your CA.
    description:
      - This is intended as a one-stop role that sets up all the components neccessary for using C(step-cli) on a given host.
      - |
        This role will perform the following steps:

        1. Install C(step-cli) if required (using the R(step_cli role,ansible_collections.maxhoesel.smallstep.step_cli_role))
        2. Install the CA root cert into the system trust store
        3. Configure the root user to automatically connect to your CA when running C(step-cli)
      - |
        Requirements:

        - Root access using C(become: yes) or equivalent
      - |
        Supported distributions:

        - Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or newer
        - Debian 10 or newer
        - Fedora 36 or newer
        - A CentOS-compatible distribution like RockyLinux/AlmaLinux 8 or newer. RockyLinux is used for testing
    options:
      step_cli_executable:
        type: path
        description:
          - What to name and where to put the C(step-cli) executable that will be installed by this role
          - Can be an absolute path (make sure that the parent directory is in C($PATH)) or a filename
          - If this executable is not found and I(step_cli_executable) is a B(path), the executable will be installed there
          - If this executable is not found and I(step_cli_executable) is a B(name), the executable will be installed at I(step_cli_install_dir) with the given name
        default: step-cli
      step_cli_version:
        type: str
        default: latest
        description:
          - Set the version of step to install
          - Can be a version tag (e.g. C(0.15.3)), or C(latest) to always install the most recent version
          - It is B(highly) recommended that your cli version matches the collection version (e.g. if you are using the collection version C(0.20.x) you should be installing step-cli version C(0.20.x) as well)
          - Note that the role will query the GitHub API if this value is set to C(latest). Try setting a specific version if you are running into rate limiting issues
      step_cli_install_dir:
        type: path
        default: "/usr/bin"
        description:
          - Used if the binary defined by I(step_cli_executable) is not found on the system and I(step_cli_executable) contains a executable name
          - Sets the directory to install I(step_cli_executable) into
          - The directory must already exist
          - Ignored if I(step_cli_executable) contains a directory already
      step_cli_steppath:
        type: path
        default: $HOME/.step
        description:
          - Optionally set a custom C($STEPPATH) for bootstrapping
          - "B(NOTE): If set, you will have to supply your custom C($STEPPATH) in all future role/module/C(step-cli) calls on this host that use the step config"
          - "Example: C(/etc/step-cli)"
      step_bootstrap_ca_url:
        type: str
        required: yes
        description:
          - URL of the step-ca CA
          - "Example: C(https://myca.localdomain)"
      step_bootstrap_fingerprint:
        type: str
        required: yes
        description:
          - Fingerprint of the CA root cert
          - This is used to verify the authenticity of the remote CA
      step_bootstrap_install_cert:
        type: bool
        default: yes
        description:
          - Whether to install the CA cert into the system root trust store(s)
          - If set to false, this role only installs C(step-cli) and configures the root user to run C(step-cli) against your CA. Other applications on your system will B(not) trust the CA, as the certificate won't be in the system trust store.
      step_bootstrap_force:
        type: bool
        default: no
        description:
          - Whether to force bootstrapping of the CA configuration.
          - If true, will cause an overwrite of any existing CA configuration, including root certificate. Useful to change the CA URL, or even change to a new CA entirely.
