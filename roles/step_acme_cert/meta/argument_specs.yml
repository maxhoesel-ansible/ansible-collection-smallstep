    short_description: Setup an auto-renewing ACME cert using step tooling
    description:
      - This role acquires a certificate from the CA via ACME, then sets up automatic renewal with C(step-cli renew)'s daemon mode
      - |
        Requirements:

        - Root access using C(become: yes) or equivalent
        - The host must be bootstrapped with R(step_bootstrap_host,ansible_collections.maxhoesel.smallstep.step_bootstrap_host_role) and the root user must be able to access the CA
      - |
        Supported distributions:

        - Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or newer
        - Debian 10 or newer
        - Fedora 36 or newer
        - A CentOS-compatible distribution like RockyLinux/AlmaLinux 8 or newer. RockyLinux is used for testing

        description:
          - Path or name of the step-cli executable to use for executing commands in this role
          - Can be an absolute path or a command (make sure the executable is in $PATH) for all users
        default: step-cli

        description:

      step_acme_cert_webroot_path:
        type: str
        default: ""
        description:
          - If set, this role will use C  (step-cli)s webroot mode to get a new certificate.
          - If empty, this role will use the standalone mode instead, causing C(step-cli) to bind itself to port 80. Make sure that no other services are listening on this port.
          - Note that C(step-cli) only needs to bind to this port when getting a B(new) certificate. It does not need to bind if it is only B(renewing) a valid certificate
